<h2>Beliefs</h2>
<p>We believe our world is too complicated and is too evil. Gtk.io is software which collates the pieces
    of information which we need to find when we need to find them. Hopefully, achieving the goal of organizing
    knowledge of things we need to master will give us the serenity which is needed to enable us to eliminate the
    evil found in the world.</p>
<h2>Instruction to users</h2>
<p>When writing a post, let it be your goal to concisely write and thus help the person reading wrap their head
    around the subject matter.</p>
