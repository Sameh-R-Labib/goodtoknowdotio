         *    - We have the previously submitted form data, although ...
         *    - The submitted time values are in timestamp form (which needs to be
         *    - converted to appear in the form again.)
         *    - We need to inform the user he is being shown the form again because
         *      we are giving him the opportunity to fix the times.
         *    - We need to present the form again.
         *    - The form needs to be populated with the previously submitted data.
