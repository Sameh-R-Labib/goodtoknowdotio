         *
         * Feature Name: "Offline The System"
         *
         * This feature enables Admin to toggle a running Gtk.io system
         * between "normal" and "offline" state.
         *
         * The offline state kicks out all non-Admin users to the login page.
         * This gives Admin the opportunity to do maintenance on the system
         * without bothering with user activity which may cause anomalies.
