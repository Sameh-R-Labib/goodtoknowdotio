        <p>

            This site is an instance of the GoodToKnow.io web app software. GoodToKnow.io web app code is GPLv3 Affero
            licensed FLOSS software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary use for this software is to facilitate the parsing and sharing of practical useful information
            via blog posts and database records. It's intended to be used for sharing amongst family and friends.
            The users are assigned communities in order to limit each user to the blog posts he / she is interested in.
            On a user-by-user basis, GoodToKnow.io web app has features for keeping track of things which a prudent
            person would want to keep track of in their personal life such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>recurring payments</li>
            <li>banking transactions</li>
            <li>tasks</li>
            <li>tax deductions</li>
            <li>taxable income events</li>
            <li>taxable gain on owned commodities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In other words you get to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>create and share blog posts</li>
            <li>keep track of personal records</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            GoodToKnow.io instances are run by (at least) one Admin who's in charge of (among other things)
            adding communities, adding topics, adding users, and approving content.
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you'd like to become a member of this GoodToKnow.io instance then contact its Admin.
            If you stumble across a different GoodToKnow.io instance (having a different URL) you can ask its Admin to
            join it.
            Otherwise, if you'd like to create your own instance you can either use the source code yourself found at
            <a href="https://github.com/Sameh-R-Labib/goodtoknowdotio" target="_blank">
                https://github.com/Sameh-R-Labib/goodtoknowdotio
            </a>
            and / or you could contact an Admin and try to persuade him / her to help you set it up. You'll find the
            email address of each instance's Admin on the login page / form.
        </p>

            Thanks and be good to one another. &mdash; <i>Sameh R. Labib</i>
