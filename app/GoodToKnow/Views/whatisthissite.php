        <h1>Software Description</h1>
        <p>This site is an instance of the GoodToKnow.io web app software. The code is GPLv3 Affero licensed FLOSS
            software. The primary use for this software is to facilitate the parsing and sharing of practical useful
            information via blog posts to be shared amongst family and a closed circle of acquaintances. The
            users are divided into communities in order to control who has access to which blog posts.
            Additionally, (on a user-by-user basis) it has features for tracking things which one would normally
            track in one's personal life such as recurring payments, banking transactions and recurring to-do list
            items. In other words you get to create and share blog posts and you get to keep track of personal
            records.</p>
        <blockquote>GoodToKnow.io instances are run by (at least) one admin who`s in charge of site maintenance and
            content approval.
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you`d like to become a member of this instance then contact its admin.
            If you stumble across a different instance you can ask its admin to join.
            Otherwise, if you'd like to create your own instance you can either use the source code yourself found at <a
                    href="https://github.com/Sameh-R-Labib/goodtoknowdotio" target="_blank">https://github.com/Sameh-R-Labib/goodtoknowdotio</a>
            or you could contact another admin and persuade them to help you set it up. You'll find the email address
            of each instance's admin on the login page/form.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks and be good to one another. &mdash; <i>Sameh R. Labib</i></p>
